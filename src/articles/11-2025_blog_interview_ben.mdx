> Start with opportunities and risks, and then build your capabilities accordingly

In a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, the introduction of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policy guidelines have posed a significant challenge for companies across the globe. To better understand the implications and opportunities of ESG, we spoke with Ben Krutzen, risk expert and Partner of Modelverse, who shared his insights on how organizations can better address the challenges posed by the new environmental, social and governance standards.

## What is the ESG framework, and why should organisations concern themselves with it?

“The ESG framework encompasses a wide array of topics, from environmental concerns such as marine ecosystems, air pollution or energy use to governance standards and social engagement,” Ben explains. He then touches upon the relevance of the new legislation frameworks that are being built to cover it: “ESG laws and reporting requirements have been in the works for quite some time in the national and supranational sphere. They have introduced very elaborate regulation and obligations for companies to understand their impact on the planet and society, and while not all companies will be legally required to report on it, this is not a reason to ignore them. It’s a topic that requires more attention than it’s currently getting, because even if an organisation is not in the scope of this regulation, their clients might be. They might have an obligation to assess their supply chain and, in turn, know how efficient their organization is in the three domains.”

## It seems that there is still a lot of ground to be won in relation to ESG. Why do we see that companies are finding it challenging to adopt the framework?

“Despite its benefits, ESG implementation is no small feat”. Krutzen elaborates on the complexity of the topic, citing the breadth and depth of ESG-related data and regulations. “Companies often struggle to determine where to begin and how to prioritize their efforts, especially when ESG policy guidelines are not yet part of their regulatory obligations but is increasingly relevant to their stakeholders.”

The EU efforts on legislating ESG is a great example: “the EU has generated the CSRD directive, coupled with the ESRS data set, which consists of an extensive list of measurable data points. These data points indicate how well you're performing on every subtopic of ESG, and that's a pretty long and complete list. To put it into perspective, these specific data points can go from disclosing information about climate and pollution activities, to water and ecosystems recorded data, to circular economy practices and usage of materials, to own workforce and supply chain workforce conditions, to impact on affected communities, to consumer and end user treatment, and to governance practices.” This breadth and depth, then, is what makes it feel like a challenge; “for each of these data points you'd have to find out ‘how can these be measured? And how can I, as an organisation, influence the numbers?’”

Notably however, pressure from affected stakeholders have prompted reviews and simplification of legislation currently in the works. “Regulations are being streamlined and thresholds for the scope of applicability are being adjusted to reduce the number of companies subject to the most stringent requirements.”

## As with any regulatory framework, compliance is only a part of the solution. How does that hold for ESG?

“ESG certification is indeed not the sole thing organisations should focus on, and as a matter of fact, the importance of the ESG framework goes beyond compliance. Following these standards can be a major strategic advantage for an organization. It allows organisations to adapt to a changing reality which is characterised by climate change, increasing social needs and resource scarcity.”

“Engaging with ESG primarily revolves around two key dimensions: opportunity creation and risk mitigation.” according to Krutzen. “Take the example of reducing your carbon footprint, which contributes to a multiplicity of goals. First and foremost, it helps mitigate climate change, which is a public good. But with regards to opportunities, it also allows you to differentiate your company from the competition, having a positive impact on clients and consumers who care about sustainability. Additionally, by reducing your resource usage, you can significantly lower your cost base, especially since the prices of materials and energy have been steadily increasing.”

## The importance of ESG engagement is clear, but how should organisations approach the topic?

To address these challenges, Krutzen advocates for a strategic approach. “At Modelverse, we believe that regardless of the domain – cybersecurity, security of operational technology, physical security, patient safety or ESG – a sound top-down strategy is essential.”

“The first step for such an approach is to understand key opportunities and risks at the organizational level. Second comes the assessment of the capabilities required for managing those risks and opportunities, which ultimately leads to the identification of capability improvement opportunities. It all comes down to understanding and constantly improving your capabilities, because through knowing what your organization is capable of, you can evaluate which gaps you want to focus on closing. This then flows into the creation of a strategic roadmap, which is ultimately based on the identified opportunities and risks.”

For leaders just beginning their ESG journey, Ben recommends starting with a high-level business analysis. “I would advise starting with a discovery phase, an analysis of the organization’s activities, services, stakeholders, and supply chain. This forms the basis for a materiality assessment, which identifies relevant opportunities and risks. The important thing is to avoid jumping straight into compliance checklists, or a bottom-up approach which can lead to a lot of unnecessary work. Because if a topic has no relevance from an opportunity or risk perspective, we can safely put it aside. Start with opportunities and risks, and then build your capabilities accordingly.”

“This is where we come in. Modelverse has a unique approach when it comes to supporting companies on their ESG journey. We offer efficient top-down methods and supporting software solutions which guide organisations through each step, from discovery to materiality assessment and capability development, to compliance and reporting.

And again, ESG is not a regulatory burden, but rather a strategic opportunity. Understanding your business and acting on sustainability can improve your reputation, structurally reduce your cost base, and contribute positively to the planet. Now is the time to leverage these opportunities and implement a strategic approach.”
