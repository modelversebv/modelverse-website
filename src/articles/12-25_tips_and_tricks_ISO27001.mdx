## Internal Audits from the ISO 27001 Perspective

Regular internal audits are mandatory under ISO 27001 (Clause 9.2). Skipping them or treating them as a mere formality can lead to serious non-conformities during the external certification audit. So, their importance is difficult to overestimate.

Beyond compliance, the added benefits make the doing of internal audits properly absolutely worth the effort. Organisations that conduct regular internal audits tend to experience significantly fewer security incidents, because issues are detected and addressed earlier.

You can think of the ISO 27001 internal audit as a health check for your ISMS, where you verify:

- The maturity and readiness of your ISMS before an external audit,
- Whether there are gaps in your controls or processes,
- Whether the system operates as it was designed,
- Whether controls are implemented and effective in practice,
- Whether there are deviations between documentation and reality,
- And whether leadership regularly reviews risks, KPIs and audit results.

Based on these checks, you can draw conclusions and define a kind of ‘treatment plan’: actions to strengthen weaknesses, close gaps and set clear milestones.

## Specific ISO 27001 Challenges for SMEs in the Information Security Sector

Getting through an ISO 27001 certification audit as a small cybersecurity and risk management company can be a serious challenge. These are some of the common pitfalls you may come across:

### 1. Third Party Risk Management

For smaller organisations, keeping track of third-party risks and performing risk reviews for every critical supplier can feel overwhelming. Third party risks do not only need to be assessed when acquiring a new supplier, but they also need to be reviewed and re-evaluated on an annual basis. Here, AI can be your friend. For example, you can ask a GAI tool such as Copilot, Gemini or ChatGPT to list any known information security incidents or data breaches associated with the supplier and to collect details about their security posture. The result can serve as a very comprehensive and insightful addition for an upcoming Management Review.

### 2. Employee Screening as a Recurring Process

Many teams assume that employee screening (ISO 27001 Annex A 6.7) is a one-off process which occurs at the start of employment. However, this is not the case; screening should be repeated annually.

But how to do this? There is a simple and effective answer: having a transparent conversation with your employees. A practical way to do this is to integrate it into annual performance reviews. During those conversations, you can:

- Discuss any personal circumstances that might introduce risks to the organisation,
- Strengthen trust and communication with employees,
- Walk through screening related topics together.

This improves both risk management and the employee-employer relationship.

### 3. Advanced Awareness and Training

Security Awareness Trainings can be perceived as repetitive and basic by employees of a company in the information security sector, as most of them have an educational background in security and relevant working experience. However, supplementary trainings are crucial. To ensure employee engagement with the trainings, these need to be more appealing, innovative and engaging for professionals in the field.

One great tool for ensuring engagement is conducting an individual assessment of every employee, not only on their knowledge of information security, but also their _beliefs_ and _opinions_. This facilitates the creation of personalised development plans towards secure behaviour, which you later go over with them.

Organisations can also lean towards creating playful initiatives that involve constantly being up to date with the latest trends in cybersecurity and emerging technologies. One example of this is the introduction of a _Monthly Incident Discussion_ with the whole team. During the meeting, one team member selects a recent incident from the news, and takes the team through the case, from the origin and method of the attack to the impact and response. This way, the whole team can keep track of the latest advancements in the field, such as major incidents and potential new attack techniques.

### 4. The Importance of Monitoring

It is one thing to tell the auditor that you have implemented a control. It is another to demonstrate that it operates as intended over time.

Key questions:

- How do you verify that policies are put into practice?
- How do you know that procedures are really being followed?

The answer is to monitor controls periodically and document the results.

For example, extremely relevant controls checks are whether the annual Third-Party Risk Review has been completed.

This is where Modelverse comes in. With our capability-based platform, organisations can implement automated controls efficiently and at scale. Modelverse enables automated third-party monitoring by accessing the third-party register, identifying critical parties based on risk ratings, and verifying whether review cycles are met. By automating these controls, Modelverse significantly reduces manual effort, ensures consistent execution, and supports continuous, reliable oversight of risk and compliance activities.

### 5. Communication

Communication can be hard; it's a science on its own. Even in the ISO 27001 context, it can mean many different things.

These are some common pitfalls in communication management that organisations should focus on:

- Communicating security policies to employees,
- Sending newsletters about developments and new features,
- and of course, having crisis communication plans in place for incidents.

One aspect that can also be underestimated is the full range of communication channels used by an organisation, including those that may not be immediately recognised as formal communication channels, such as the organisation’s website and LinkedIn. These platforms are used to disseminate information regarding the organisation’s products, methodologies, and positions on GRC and information risk management and therefore must be formally incorporated into the ISMS communications framework in their entirety.

### 6. The Value of an External Internal Auditor

As a small company, you can find yourself in a situation where you do not have an objective and independent resource to perform the internal audit. A solution on that is inviting an experienced external auditor.

The use of a third-party auditor for internal audits brings several advantages, not due to a lack of trust in employees’ ability to objectively and critically assess colleagues’ work, nor because management would be unwilling to carefully consider the observations and recommendations of an internal auditor from within the organisation. Rather, an external internal auditor:

- Brings fresh, unbiased perspectives and experience from other organisations,
- Increases confidence in readiness for the certification audit,
- Familiarises the team with typical audit agendas, lines of questioning, and discussion formats,
- Helps identify which findings are most material and must be addressed prior to the external audit.

## Recurring Structural Challenges with ISO 27001

- <u>Documentation vs Reality:</u> A strong policy on paper is not enough if
  implementation is weak. For example, a solid offboarding policy is useless if
  IT does not consistently revoke access when employees leave.
- <u>New Controls in ISO 27001:2022:</u> The 2022 revision reduced the number of
  controls to 93 and grouped them into four themes (Organisational, People,
  Physical and Technological). It also introduced new controls such as Threat
  Intelligence and Cloud Security. Audit programs need to be updated to evaluate
  the effectiveness of these new controls.
- <u>Inappropriate Sampling Focus:</u> It is easy to spend too much time on
  low-risk areas while neglecting high risk or fast evolving components such as
  cloud systems or critical third parties.
- <u>Ensuring Robust Root Cause Analysis:</u> Once a non-conformity is detected,
  it takes effort and discipline to identify the root cause instead of applying
  a quick “patch”. Without proper root cause analysis, the same issues will keep
  coming back.

If you are implementing or maintaining an ISMS, we hope these lessons, pitfalls and tips help you:

- Treat internal audits as a real health check for your ISMS;
- Use them as a tool for continuous improvement;
- And see them not as a hurdle, but as an investment in resilience and trust.
