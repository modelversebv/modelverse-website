  summary:
    'This blog post explains what Tabletop Exercises (TTX) are and how they help assess an organization’s preparedness for cybersecurity incidents beyond policies and theory. It highlights their value in testing decision-making, team coordination, and response processes under pressure, and emphasizes that a successful TTX focuses on identifying real gaps and turning them into concrete actions that strengthen resilience and security culture.',

In a world where cyber threats are constantly present and evolving, preparedness is no longer optional for organisations. Cyber incidents can create serious disruption, not only for institutions but also for the “everyday person” through service outages, data exposure, and cascading operational impacts. Strengthening readiness therefore requires more than policies on paper. It requires practice.

A Tabletop Exercise (TTX) is distinct from an active incident simulation. Unlike exercises that use electronic devices or technical tooling to simulate events in live systems, a TTX is a discussion-based exercise around the hypothetical occurrence of a cybersecurity incident and does not include any interaction with electronic systems. Participants are placed into a plausible cyberattack scenario that unfolds over time. As the scenario progresses, they examine and debate what they would do at each moment, using their existing procedures and internal coordination mechanisms.

## Why Run a TTX?

The main goal is to test how well the organisation’s response and recovery processes work when people must make decisions under uncertainty and time pressure.

 This makes it possible to identify issues and limitations before a real incident exposes them and therefore helps organisations enhance and improve their response to cyber threats.

TTXs also promote and encourage communication, collaborative problem solving, and decision-making between people and departments. Participants can challenge each other’s assumptions, share insights, and detect flaws or missing elements in the current procedures.

Because TTXs are discussion-based and cross-organisational, they are also an effective way to clarify roles and responsibilities across stakeholders. This matters because during real incidents, coordination problems often prove to be one of the main issues.

Finally, TTXs are typically low-risk and cost-effective, because they do not require live technical interaction with systems and do not introduce operational risks in the way certain technical simulations might.

## The Learning Effect: Awareness, Confidence, and Culture

A TTX increases knowledge among employees about what they are expected to do during a crisis. That increases confidence and adaptability and ultimately makes the organisation more protected when a real incident occurs. It also helps close skills gaps by allowing staff to learn through practical, experience-based discussion rather than purely theoretical training.

Training leads to more awareness. More training leads to even more, creating cumulative knowledge gains and, in many organisations, a meaningful competitive advantage.

TTXs also support a cultural shift: they help people who previously saw cybersecurity as “not their job” understand exactly how they fit into the bigger picture. In practice, this is often where organisations move from “security is the security team’s problem” to “security is a shared responsibility.”

## The Four-Phase TTX Process

TTXs are often built using established exercise frameworks that guide how to plan, design, run, and evaluate them. While approaches differ, the process is usually structured into four phases:

1. Planning
2. Design
3. Execution
4. Evaluation

A TTX is delivered by a specialized provider organisation. Delivering a TTX requires the involvement of multiple organizer personnel. These people are assigned different roles across different phases of the TTX needed to develop the exercise and are coordinated under the TTX Exercise Leadership Team.

Another central point in successful delivery is the involvement of the organisation that is receiving the TTX service. A representative of this organisation should be present across all phases. This representative provides expectations, constraints, feedback, and specific “rules” they want applied in the exercise. The constant communication and tailoring is essential because it safeguards the receiving organisation’s interests and ensures continuous tailoring.

### Phase 1: Pre-Planning and Planning

In this initial stage, the organizer and the receiver of the service hold meetings to decide the foundation of the exercise:

#### _Objectives, Theme, and Scope_

- Objectives: These should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound). Examples include validating the accuracy of recovery procedures, testing escalation decisions, or clarifying the roles of each team member under pressure.
- Theme: The type of cyber incident selected which should match the objectives (for example ransomware, data leakage, third-party compromise, insider threats, or disruption of critical services).
- Scope: Who will participate (and at what seniority and functional coverage). Scope directly affects complexity, duration, realism, and the logistics of the session.

Decisions made here can be adjusted later due to logistical changes (for example a venue change) or exercise changes (for example a scenario adjustment). However, modifications should always be made with the receiver of the service, not unilaterally.

### Phase 2: Designing the Exercise

The design stage is about creating the materials that will produce a realistic and useful session.

Typical design work includes:

- Conducting scenario research when needed
- Reviewing the organisation’s documentation for incident prevention, response, and recovery
- Building the scenario narrative with a realistic starting situation and a sequence of “injects” that advance the story
- Writing injects so they prompt discussion and decision-making, often with explicit response options

_What are injects?_

Injects are the central mechanism that brings a tabletop exercise to life. They consist of previously prepared information or events that are introduced throughout the simulation to represent how a real incident evolves. Their function is to force participants to react, make decisions and coordinate as the situation changes.

These injects can take a variety of forms, such as emails, phone calls, internal communications, media releases or social media posts, to reflect the complexity and pressure of a real incident. They are usually organized in a chronological sequence which allows facilitators to control the pace and flow of the exercise.

Example of an inject:

Inject 3 – Media Escalation (T+45 minutes)

A journalist from a national news outlet contacts the communications team stating that they have evidence of a cyberattack affecting customer data and are preparing to publish an article within the next hour. At the same time, screenshots alleging a data breach begin circulating on social media.

- Who is notified at this stage?
- Does the organisation confirm, deny, or delay public communication?
- How do legal, communications, and executive teams coordinate the response?

#### _Documentation and Supporting Resources_

During the design phase, a tailored set of documentation, materials, logistical resources, and feedback tools for exercise organisers and exercise participants is developed to support the scenario. These include a full incident script for organisers, a participant form to respond to the exercise’s questions and other supplementary documents.

### Phase 3: Execution

Execution is the live session itself:

- Facilitators guide the session and introduce injects to simulate how real events might unfold, while monitors observe and record actions, reasoning, and communication dynamics.
- Participants work through the injects of the simulated incident by following internal procedures and making decisions as the scenario evolves.

From this session, the observations recorded by the exercise data collectors and the response forms completed by the participants are collected via their response forms and monitor notes. 

### Phase 4: Evaluation, After-Action Review, and Hotwash

The final phase consists of analysing all the just mentioned collected data to draw concrete conclusions about participant behaviour during the exercise. An After-Action Report (AAR) is then produced, including improvement recommendations that will feed into the next preparedness cycle. These findings are subsequently presented to the organisation that received the TTX during a “hotwash” session.

The conclusions extracted from this session are meant to prompt the organisations to undergo the necessary changes in the organisation’s crisis management procedures to cover its discovered gaps.

## The TTX is Finished, Now What?

The central idea is that an exercise is useful when it helps identify concrete improvements in current procedures, decision-making processes, and coordination mechanisms, or even uncovers new learnings for the organization. The fact that these improvement opportunities emerge does not mean that the exercise went wrong, but rather that it worked as it should.

However, detecting errors is of no use if everything is later left in a forgotten presentation, and no real action is taken. What really matters is that concrete changes come out of it: someone who takes responsibility, documents that are updated, processes that are corrected, and new tests to verify that it now works. If there is nothing to fix, the exercise was probably too smooth

A good result is when the team leaves with the feeling of having responded as a group, despite knowing that there is still work to be done. This shared experience is what makes the way of working evolve. At the same time, it helps people who were not involved in security to clearly understand how their work influences the whole.

Essentially, these exercises make security a collective responsibility and create an environment where shortcomings can be pointed out without looking for blame. The ultimate goal is not to look good in a report, but to obtain a clear vision that allows you to justify improvements, organisational changes and future investments.
