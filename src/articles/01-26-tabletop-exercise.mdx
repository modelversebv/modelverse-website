In a world where cyber threats are truly present and constantly evolving, preparedness is no longer optional for organizations or individuals. Cyber incidents can create serious disruption, not only for institutions but also for the “everyday person” through service outages, data exposure, and cascading operational impacts. Strengthening readiness therefore requires more than policies on paper. It requires practice.

A Tabletop Exercise (TTX) is distinct from an active incident simulation. Unlike exercises that use electronic devices or technical tooling to simulate events in live systems, a TTX is a discussion-based exercise around the hypothetical occurrence of a cybersecurity incident and does not include any interaction with electronic systems. Participants from an organization are placed into a plausible cyberattack scenario that unfolds over time. As the scenario progresses, they examine and debate what they would do at each moment, using their existing procedures and internal coordination mechanisms.

The main goal is to test how well the organization’s prevention, response, and recovery processes actually work when people must make decisions under uncertainty and time pressure.

## Why Run a TTX?

The core benefit is that they test the effectiveness of your cyber crisis management framework. This makes it possible to identify issues and limitations in that framework before a real incident exposes them, and therefore helps organizations enhance and improve their response to cyber threats.

TTXs also promote and encourage communication, collaborative problem solving, and decision-making between workers and departments. They create collective engagement discussions where different backgrounds and different experience levels naturally produce different response strategies. Participants can challenge each other’s assumptions, share insights, and detect flaws or missing elements in the current system.

Because TTXs are discussion-based and cross-organizational, they are also an effective way to ensure and clarify roles, duties, and responsibilities across stakeholders. This matters because during real incidents, coordination problems often become the main driver of impact.

Finally, TTXs are typically low-risk and cost-effective, because they do not require live technical interaction with systems and do not introduce operational danger in the way certain technical simulations might.

## The Learning Effect: Awareness, Confidence, and Culture

A TTX increases knowledge among employees about what they are expected to do during a crisis. That increases confidence and adaptability, and ultimately makes the organization more protected when a real incident occurs. It also helps close skills gaps by allowing staff to learn through practical, experience-based discussion rather than purely theoretical training.

Training leads to more awareness. More training leads to even more, creating cumulative knowledge gains and, in many organizations, a meaningful competitive advantage.

TTXs also support a cultural shift: they help people who previously saw cybersecurity as “not their job” understand exactly how they fit into the bigger picture. In practice, this is often where organizations move from “security is the security team’s problem” to “security is a shared responsibility.”

## The Four-Phase TTX Process

TTXs are often built using established exercise frameworks that guide how to plan, design, run, and evaluate them. While approaches differ, the process is usually structured into four phases:

1. planning
2. design
3. execution

A TTX requires several personnel involved in the different phases of the exercise, these will be assignated and lead by the Exercise Leadership Team. These personnel and its functions will further be developed in the full explanation of each phase.

A central point in successful delivery is client involvement. A representative of the client organization should be present across all phases. This role is essential because it safeguards the client’s interests and ensures continuous tailoring. The client provides expectations, constraints, feedback, and specific “rules” they want applied in the exercise. This constant communication and tailoring is what makes a TTX actually successful and impactful.

Where objectives are unclear or “fuzzy,” the organizer should advise by studying the organization’s context and helping translate broad concerns into concrete exercise objectives and evaluation criteria.

### Phase 1: Pre-Planning and Planning

In this initial stage, the organizer and the client hold meetings to decide the foundation of the exercise:

#### _Objectives, Theme, and Scope_

- Objectives: These should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound). Examples include validating the accuracy of recovery procedures, testing escalation decisions, or clarifying the roles of each team member under pressure.
- Theme: The type of cyber incident selected should match the objectives (for example ransomware, data leakage, third-party compromise, insider threats, or disruption of critical services).
- Scope: Who will participate (and at what seniority and functional coverage). Scope directly affects complexity, duration, realism, and the logistics of the session.

This stage typically also defines:

- A timeline across phases, including all meetings with and without the client
- Date and time of the TTX
- Time needed to prepare the space
- Time needed to tidy up the space
- Duration of the exercise
- Place of execution
- People and organizations present
- Fees for the client

Decisions made here can be adjusted later due to logistical changes (for example a venue change) or exercise changes (for example a scenario adjustment). However, modifications should always be made with the client, not unilaterally.

#### _TTX personnel involved in this phase:_

The **Exercise Planning Team** works closely with **the Leadership Team** to define the objectives, scope, and timeline of the TTX. It typically includes leadership members, a designated briefer or scribe, and representatives from participating organizations or external stakeholders, depending on the exercise scope. Together, the Planning and Leadership Teams distribute roles and tasks across all personnel involved in the exercise.

- **Exercise Planner:** Supports planning activities and ensures continuity and follow-through across meetings.
- **Exercise Scribe:** Documents decisions, action items, and key discussion points from planning meetings and shares them with all planning participants.
- **External Stakeholders / Organizations:** Contribute expertise, context, and operational requirements when relevant.

### Phase 2: Designing the Exercise

The design stage is about creating the materials that will produce a realistic and useful session.

Typical design work includes:

- Conducting scenario research when needed
- Reviewing the organization’s documentation for incident prevention, response, and recovery
- Building the scenario narrative with a realistic starting situation and a sequence of “injects” that advance the story
- Writing injects so they prompt discussion and decision-making, often with explicit response options

_What are injects?_

Injects are the central mechanism that brings a tabletop exercise to life. They consist of previously prepared information or events that are introduced throughout the simulation to represent how a real incident evolves. Their function is to force participants to react, make decisions and coordinate as the situation changes.

These injects can take a variety of forms, such as emails, phone calls, internal communications, media releases or social media posts, to reflect the complexity and pressure of a real incident. They are usually organized in a chronological sequence which allows facilitators to control the pace and flow of the exercise.

In addition to planned injects, facilitators can introduce adjustments or contingency injects if the discussion gets stuck or if the exercise needs to be redirected to achieve the set objectives. Overall, the injections serve to keep the exercise dynamic, realistic and demanding, and to test whether response plans actually work when put under pressure.

Example of an inject:

Inject 3 – Media Escalation (T+45 minutes)

A journalist from a national news outlet contacts the communications team stating that they have evidence of a cyberattack affecting customer data and are preparing to publish an article within the next hour. At the same time, screenshots alleging a data breach begin circulating on social media.

- Who is notified at this stage?
- Does the organization confirm, deny, or delay public communication?
- How do legal, communications, and executive teams coordinate the response?

#### _Documentation and Supporting Resources_

To support the scenario and ensure smooth execution, a comprehensive set of **concrete documentation and resources** is developed during the design phase. These typically include:

- A **facilitator guide** for the exercise facilitator(s) that narrates the full exercise, scenario flow, inject timing, decision points, and alternative injects or outcomes depending on participant actions 
- Visual and narrative support materials, such as presentations, images, and other visual aids that reinforce realism and immersion
- A **participant schedule guide** outlining the structure and timing of the TTX 
- A **participant explanatory guide** detailing the concrete scenario and context
- Additional documents that may be introduced dynamically as the exercise unfolds

Operational and logistical resources are also prepared as needed, including identification badges, table tents, and any necessary audio-visual equipment such as microphones, projectors, or screens.

Finally, forms to capture participant input and feedback are also created, these include **participant response forms** and **participant evaluation forms**, which feed directly into the post-exercise analysis.

As with all stages of a TTX, these materials are **fully tailored to each client**, ensuring that the exercise aligns with their organizational structure, maturity level, risk profile, and specific objectives.

#### _TTX personnel involved in this phase:_

**The Exercise Design Team** is responsible for creating a tailored and realistic Tabletop Exercise aligned with the client’s needs and organizational context.

- **Exercise Lead Designer:** Oversees the design workflow, ensures quality and timeliness, and coordinates with other teams and client to maintain consistency across the exercise lifecycle and ensure tailoring to the client’s needs.
- **Exercise Designer:** Develops the scenario, injects, and interactive elements, using creativity and innovation to ensure engagement and realism.
- **Exercise Researcher:** Compiles and analyses relevant information, such as threat intelligence and organizational documentation, to support accurate and credible scenario design.

### Phase 3: Execution

Execution is the live session itself:

- Facilitators guide the session and introduce injects to simulate how real events might unfold, while monitors observe and record actions, reasoning, and communication dynamics.
- Participants work through the injects of the simulated incident by following internal procedures and making decisions as the scenario evolves.

From this session, the observations recorded by the monitors (scribes) and the response forms completed by the participants are collected via their response forms and monitor notes.

####  _TTX personnel involved in this phase:_

The **Exercise Conduction Team** is responsible for delivering the TTX on site. Its duties include preparing the space, briefing participants, assigning roles, facilitating discussions, distributing materials, and supporting participants throughout the exercise.

- **Exercise Lead Facilitator:** Manages the overall on-site execution and facilitation of the exercise
- **Co-Facilitator / Narrator:** Supports scenario narration and participant guidance.
- **Data Collector / Observer:** Captures observations, participant decisions, and feedback during the exercise and shares them with the Leadership Team.
- **Additional Helpers:** Provide logistical or participant support as needed.

### Phase 4: Evaluation, After-Action Review, and Hotwash

The final phase consists of analysing all of the just mentioned collected data to draw concrete conclusions about participant behaviour during the exercise. An After-Action Report (AAR) is then produced, including improvement recommendations that will feed into the next preparedness cycle. These findings are subsequently presented to the client and the participants during a “hotwash” session, or immediate debrief discussion.

The conclusions extracted from this session are meant to prompt the organisations to undergo the necessary changes in the organisation’s crisis management procedures to cover its discovered gaps.

#### TTX personnel involved in this phase:

The **Exercise Conduction Team** is responsible for delivering the TTX on site. Its duties include preparing the space, briefing participants, assigning roles, facilitating discussions, distributing materials, and supporting participants throughout the exercise.

- **Exercise Lead Facilitator:** Manages the overall on-site execution and facilitation of the exercise.
- **Co-Facilitator / Narrator:** Supports scenario narration and participant guidance.
- **Data Collector / Observer:** Captures observations, participant decisions, and feedback during the exercise and shares them with the Leadership Team.
- **Additional Helpers:** Provide logistical or participant support as needed.

## The TTX is Finished, Now What? What Makes a TTX Valuable?

The central idea is that an exercise is useful when it highlights what is normally not seen: confusion, organizational gaps, procedures that no longer serve or roles that no one was clear about. The fact that these problems appear does not mean that the exercise went wrong, but rather that it worked as it should.

However, as just mentioned, a TTX needs to provoke real transformation. Detecting errors is of no use if everything is later left in a forgotten presentation and no real action is taken. What really matters is that concrete changes come out of it: someone who takes responsibility, documents that are updated, processes that are corrected and new tests to verify that it now works. If there is nothing to fix, the exercise was probably too smooth

A good result is when the team leaves with the feeling of having responded as a group, despite knowing that there is still work to be done. This shared experience is what makes the way of working evolve. At the same time, it helps people who were not involved in security to clearly understand how their work influences the whole.

Essentially, these exercises make security a collective responsibility and create an environment where shortcomings can be pointed out without looking for blame. The ultimate goal is not to look good in a report, but to obtain a clear vision that allows you to justify improvements, organizational changes and future investments.
