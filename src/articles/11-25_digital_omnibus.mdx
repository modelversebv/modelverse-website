The European Commission has officially presented its Digital Omnibus Package, a sweeping set of amendments designed to streamline and modernise the EU’s digital regulatory framework.

The package is built around two pillars:

1. [Digital Omnibus on Cyber, Data & Privacy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-omnibus-regulation-proposal)
2. [Digital Omnibus on Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-omnibus-ai-regulation-proposal)

It will later be complemented by the [Data Union Strategy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-union) and the rollout of [European Business Wallets](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2718).

The goal? To simplify by design.

Right now, EU digital rules are fragmented, overlapping, and often vague: a complex puzzle that raises compliance costs, creates legal uncertainty, and slows innovation. The Digital Omnibus aims to fix this by reducing administrative burdens and offering clearer, more coherent obligations for businesses of all sizes.

The proposal is still awaiting review by the European Parliament and Council, but if approved, it would bring some of the most transformative changes to EU digital regulation in years. Below is a breakdown of what’s coming.

## The Data Act: Towards a Single, Unified Data Regulation

For years, organisations have faced a maze of overlapping EU data laws : the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data Regulation (FFDR), the Data Governance Act (DGA), the Open Data Directive (ODD) and the ePrivacy Directive, each setting different rules for who can share what, with whom, and under which conditions.

The Digital Omnibus proposes a major consolidation: all four instruments merged into a renewed, streamlined Data Act, which becomes the EU’s central framework for the data economy.

Key changes include:

- Stronger trade secret protection, allowing data holders to refuse disclosure where misuse or weak protections abroad pose risks.
- Narrower business-to-government (B2G) data-sharing obligations, now limited to clearly defined public emergencies.
- Voluntary registration for data intermediaries.
- Functional rather than legal separation required for data intermediation services.
- Ability for public sector bodies to charge higher fees to Digital Markets Act (DMA) gatekeepers for re-use of public data.
- Incorporation of the free-flow-of-data principle, which directly embeds the ban on unjustified non-personal data localisation restrictions into the Data Act.

## GDPR: Redefining “Personal Data”

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) revision addresses one of the most persistent sources of confusion: what actually counts as personal data?

The revision clarifies that data is only “personal” for a controller if that controller can reasonably identify the individual, considering the means actually available to them.

This is especially important for pseudonymised data:

- If a recipient cannot reasonably re-identify someone, the data is not personal data for that entity.
- Disproportionate time, cost or effort do not count as “reasonable means”.

## New GDPR rules to support responsible AI development

The proposal introduces:

- An explicit legitimate interest legal basis for processing personal data in AI (Artificial Intelligence) development and operation, subject to safeguards including:
  - data minimisation,
  - proportionality checks,
  - unconditional right to object,
  - measures to detect/remove residual special-category data.

The Omnibus also proposes a harmonised EU-wide Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) list and a common methodology, ending the patchwork of national approaches.

## GDPR Cookie Reform: Ending “Consent Fatigue”

Cookie banners are widely recognised as intrusive, inconsistent, and ineffective. The Digital Omnibus integrates cookie rules from the ePrivacy Directive directly into the GDPR to ensure consistency across websites and applications.

Key changes include:

- Single-click opt-out must be offered.
- A clear legal basis for essential cookies.
- Universal user preference settings that browsers and apps must respect.
- A six-month “cool-off” period before re-asking for consent for the same purpose.

## Cybersecurity: One EU-Wide Incident Notification Portal

Today, companies must notify cyber incidents under NIS2, GDPR, DORA, Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER), ePrivacy Directive and other sectoral laws, often for the same incident.

The Digital Omnibus proposes a streamlined solution:

- A single EU incident notification portal — the Single Entry Point (SEP).
- A “notify once, share widely” system across all relevant authorities.
- GDPR deadlines extended from 72 to 96 hours.
- Notification only required for high-risk breaches.
- A harmonised EU breach-notification template designed by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).

The Commission estimates up to €5 billion in savings by 2029.

## Digital Omnibus on AI: Smoother, Clearer Implementation of the AI Act

Public consultations showed that organisations were struggling with the practical rollout of the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act). To address this, the Omnibus introduces targeted fixes to simplify compliance and reduce costs:

- Reduced documentation and registration requirements for narrow-use high-risk AI systems.
- Extension of simplified requirements from SMEs (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) to Small Mid-Caps (SMCs).
- Centralised EU-level oversight for General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models deployed on very large platforms and search engines.
- Increased emphasis on AI sandboxes and real-world testing frameworks.
- A strengthened EU AI Office to coordinate national regulators, develop benchmarks and ensure harmonised implementation.

## European Business Wallet: A Digital Identity for Every Company

Finally, the introduction of the European Business Wallet will allow companies to:

- Digitally sign, seal and timestamp documents,
- Store and exchange verified corporate records,
- Interact easily with public authorities across all 27 EU Member States.

This should drastically streamline incorporation, regulatory filings, procurement, licensing and cross-border operations.

## Conclusion

The Digital Omnibus Package is the EU’s most ambitious attempt yet to clean, simplify and modernise its digital rulebook. Rather than adding new layers of regulation, it restructures, harmonises and clarifies existing ones with the aim of making them more practical, coherent and innovation-friendly.

Still, it is uncertain whether these intended results will fully materialise in practice. Member States may continue to face challenges with such a broad omnibus approach, and it remains to be seen whether the promise of real simplification will translate into everyday regulatory reality.

At Modelverse, we stay ahead of the latest developments in the EU’s cybersecurity and digital innovation regulatory landscape. Our goal is simple: help organisations adapt quickly and confidently.

The Digital Omnibus Package is still in the pipeline, but DORA, NIS2, CRA, CER and other frameworks are already a reality.
