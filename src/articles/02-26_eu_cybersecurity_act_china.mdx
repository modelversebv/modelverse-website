  summary:
    'The EU’s plan to overhaul the Cybersecurity Act could reshape its entire ICT supply chain — and China is pushing back hard. By introducing new risk assessments for foreign tech providers, the EU aims to boost digital sovereignty, but Beijing warns the move threatens market access and bilateral relations. Is Europe strengthening its security, or escalating a global tech divide?',

The proposal to transform the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA) by the European Commission (EC) is facing strong opposition from the Chinese Government. Their main point of contention centres around the belief that the proposed changes in the EU ICT supply chain would affect them disproportionately.

The EC proposal, which was published on the 20th of January, encapsulates a renewal of the existing CSA as well as amendments to the NIS2 framework, with a focus on ICT suppliers from high-risk countries. The changes aim to prevent security vulnerabilities, limit foreign interference, and decrease the systemic dependency the EU has on non-EU ICT providers.

## What does the proposed ICT supply chain change entail?

The updated CSA framework would introduce the EU’s first legislation that manages 'non‑technical’ risks in ICT supply chains. If adopted, the European Commission would be mandated to identify which ICT products and services are considered “key ICT assets” based on several factors. This for example includes the asset’s criticality, existing supplier dependencies, the potential impact of disruption or data theft, and findings from other EU‑level risk assessments. Alongside this, the Commission would also engage in the process of conducting both technical and non-technical risk assessments with the aim of assigning foreign countries and companies appropriate risk levels.

These non-technical risks consider a multitude of variables that may affect the European Union, including the existence of data protection and privacy legislation, responsible conduct in the field of cybersecurity, the presence of espionage activities, actions that may indicate the undermining of human rights, and whether effective democratic oversight and judicial remedies are in place.

China, being one of the EU’s biggest trading partners, would also be subject to the proposed risk assessment mechanisms. And given the strong ties China-based ICT companies have with the Chinese state there is a high likelihood that they would receive a high-risk rating. This could result in different outcomes for different suppliers and will generally result in increased scrutiny and usage limitations, but if deemed necessary high-risk providers can also be outright banned, which would to lead to a shift towards alternative EU-aligned providers.

Electronic communication networks such as mobile, fixed and satellite would fall under an even stricter regime, recorded in the ‘5G toolbox’. ICT components in this category provided by high-risk suppliers would have to be phased out from the identified key ICT assets in a timelier manner. Phase‑out deadlines include a maximum of 36 months for mobile networks, and Commission‑set timelines for fixed and satellite systems.

The supposed effects of this change would be substantial; not only due to the economic costs for the EU, but also due to the impact on trade relations with the countries hosting potential high-risk suppliers, like China.

## The motivation behind the proposal

The proposal can be read as a response to the increasingly turbulent geopolitical landscape. The Commission argues that the different national treatment Member States give high-risk ICT providers creates barriers to the free movement of goods and services and generates legal uncertainty. The measures are also presented as being necessary to limit foreign surveillance and espionage, in turn protecting citizens’ privacy.

Switching to new suppliers for critical infrastructure will impose burdensome costs However, the Commission considers that the long-term benefits the transition would yield for security and competitiveness outweighs these costs greatly.

## What is Beijing’s reaction?

The Chinese government has shown absolute rejection towards the proposal, presumably because they fear the consequences of being classified as a high-risk supplier. From the Chinese perspective, their relationship with Europe has so far been rather fruitful and low risk in terms of supplying critical service components. In a recent statement they doubled down on the idea that Chinese companies have always acted in accordance with EU law, especially in the provision of safe and high-quality ICT products.

The Chinese government also emphasises that the “lack of trust” demonstrated by the EU is a significant threat to EU-China relations. Moreover, they have argued that this move hinders the EU’s technological progress and economic development by damaging the image of Europe’s market openness in this sector – making this a loss-loss situation.

However, if the EC proposal were to be adopted, and China were to be deemed high-risk, enterprises from the country would also receive access to an exemption mechanism. Among other conditions they would need to provide evidence that they employ effective mitigation techniques which ensure the absence of undue interference.

## What remains to be seen?

In the end, the true impact of this proposal will only become clear if it is approved and implemented across the Union. It may reinforce unity among Member States by centralising their approach to ICT risk management, but it could also lead to further fractioning within the EU if the burdens are distributed unevenly. At the international level, the proposal would signal a firmer and more assertive EU stance in the rapidly polarising global technology landscape, with significant consequences for Chinese suppliers.
